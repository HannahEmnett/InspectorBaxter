# Modified ROS wrapper for pocketsphinx  

The following repositories were used in our wrapper, but are not required for installation:

* Original repository: https://github.com/mikeferguson/pocketsphinx  

* Also used repo: https://github.com/gorinars/ros_voice_control  

It uses up-to-date pocketsphinx features and is independent of most external dependencies.  

Current repository is a ROS wrapper which incorporates those features.

## Installation
1)   
    ```
    sudo apt-get install -y python python-dev python-pip build-essential swig libpulse-dev git
    sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio
    ```

2) pocketsphinx: You will need to have pip preinstalled for this to work
    ```
    sudo pip install pocketsphinx
    ```
3) Download and copy the hub4wsj_sc_8k language model  to /usr/share/pocketsphinx/model/hmm/en_US/. It can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/Archive/US%20English%20HUB4WSJ%20Acoustic%20Model/)

4) Git clone our repository into the your catkin workspace's src folder:
  ```
  cd ~/catkin_ws/src
  git clone https://github.com/UTNuclearRoboticsPublic/pocketsphinx.git  
  ```
## Usage
```
roslaunch pocketsphinx pocketsphinx.launch
```

## Using your own keywords

You can run this with any set of words. To do that, you need lexicon and keyword list files (check voice_cmd.dic and voice_cmd.kwlist for details).

Word pronunciations for English can be found in CMUdict

You can also download pocketsphinx acoustic models for several other languages here
